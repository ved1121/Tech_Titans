# Project Overview
Pilgrim Tale's is an innovative project aimed at enriching children's curiosity about religious places by offering an Augmented Reality (AR) experience of the history and significant incidents associated with those places. Through the use of AR technology, users can scan a card or marker related to a particular religious site and immerse themselves in a 5 to 10-minute short animated clip, enhancing their learning experience.

# Features
AR Experience: Users can access immersive animated clips by scanning a designated card or marker associated with a religious place.
Educational Content: The animated clips provide insights into the history and significant events related to the religious site, fostering better understanding and appreciation.
Multilingual Support: To cater to a diverse audience, the animated videos come with multiple dubbed languages, ensuring that non-native visitors can also enjoy and understand the essence of the place.

# How It Works
Scan the Marker: Users need to scan the designated card or marker using their device's camera within the Pilgrim Tale's app.
Augmented Reality: Upon scanning, users will be transported into an augmented reality environment where they can view the animated clip related to the religious place.
Immersive Learning: Users can enjoy a visually engaging experience while learning about the history and significant events associated with the religious site.
Multilingual Experience: The animated clip is available in various languages, allowing users from different linguistic backgrounds to enjoy and understand the content.

# Benefits
Enhanced Learning: Augmented reality provides a more interactive and engaging learning experience, encouraging children to explore and understand religious places better.
Cultural Appreciation: By showcasing the history and essence of religious sites, Pilgrim Tale's promotes cultural appreciation and understanding.
